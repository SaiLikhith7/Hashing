# Hashing
This project concentrates mostly on comparing two files and giving output as the matched strings from two files.
Step1:
We were given a file having a lot of hased strings(hashcodes) and were asked to decrypt the passwords.
Step2:
Take the file which has the list of the hashcodes, look for the wordlists in internet which has most frequently used passwords.
Step3:
Take the wordlist and insert it into same folder in which this hash.py would be present.
Step4:
Mark the file name in the place of the "Test2.txt"
Step5:
Give your hashcodes filename in the place of "Test1.txt"
Step6:
Note the output from the Marked list

Our duty is to use the wordlist to hash and to compare with the wordlist having hashed strings. The matched strings may be the passwords of the corresponding strings.
